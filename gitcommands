git init - initializes git project.
Git has three areas:
A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project
git status - used to check status of a project.  Files in red are untracked. Files in green are tracked.
git add <filename> - used to add filename to the staging area.
git diff <filename> - used to check differences between working directory and staging area. Changes to the file are marked in green.
git commit -m "<message>" - used to permanently store changes from the staging area into the repository
git log - is used to view earlier versions of a project
